                            <p> Shoot me an offer for any or all of these games. I loved everything about Darwinia (https://www.introversion.co.uk/darwinia/). I tried Prison Architect by the same developer and couldn't get into it. Aside from the story, graphics and music, I guess it was the real time strategy tactics/strategy and micro management aspect that I liked, but none of those things were overwhelming - the learning curve was low. I'm just a casual gamer Hello all again, So I just bought Prison Architect because it is the weekend deal and I have been looking to get it. So I got the above 4 games in a bundle. I already had them from a steam sale two years ago. So now I am doing another giveaway. Once again we will be doing a random number but this time between 1-500. You may only win one of the games but please in your comment say your the order of the one you want the most to the one you want the least. and by this I will determine Put in your reply the title of the game that you want: ~~Contraption Maker~~ ~~Darwinia~~ ~~DEFCON~~ ~~Frozen Synapse Prime~~ ~~ibb amp obb~~ ~~Multiwinia~~ ~~Spacechem~~ ~~Space Farmers~~ ~~Tristoy~~ ~~Uplink~~ Also add in the method you prefer to receive the Steam gift (through e-mail or through adding friends). edit: Please remember to confirm reception. edit 2: Adding in two new games from a Humble Bundle: ~~Killing Floor~~ ~~The. Two days into the 14 day Humble Introversion Bundle ( they made close to half a mil. A percentage of this goes towards charity, the bonus games, a tip to Wolfire. but for a small studio like Introversion this must still be a huge financial stability burst. The numbers remind me of Amnesia dev Frictional Games. I heard Introversion was close to finished and were saved by a Steam sale. Now this seems similar. Subversion seems Strike Vector - 2.5 Keys ~~Gun Monkeys - Offer~~ - Sold I accept pure or overpay in items, So send me a friend request or trade offer. Everything you need is on my profile. http://steamcommunity.com/id/GenericPath. 
EDIT 3: Rewards are sent to all the winner EDIT 2: My grandfather is helping me picking up winners (the old fashioned way: Ctrl+F). His quote: "These random strangers are so nice". The names of the winners are next to the game Winners will receive a pm from me, and please reply me with you Steam offer link or your steam email so I can gift the game to you. This is my story: Few months ago, my grandfather was diagnosed with cancer. My family was devastated when the doctor Games + Source Code @ This week's Humble Bundle Nice move by Introversion Software! http://www.humblebundle.com/weekly. see if your offer is fair first. I recently got Darknet and I love all the logic behind it and how you have to think strategically to hack the whole network. I have just one question regarding the game. Is it kind of infinite(generated randomly) or does it have a fixed number of levels? If it is infinite, then it's great since i've been wondering if there are games on the gear that are randomly generated Crosspost from r/truegaming upon suggestion. I'm hosting a gaming tournament to kick off a LAN party but I need games that most people probably wouldn't have ever played. It's preferable that the platform is PC but XBLA is probably acceptable as well I'm looking for Indie Games that could work in a tournament. The genres can range anywhere but racing, platformer, and shoot-em-ups would probably work best. I would like to have 4 person coop games in there as well in order to make the tournament. 
I just bought The Indie Gala Colossus bundle and I already own these games, don't need them. One game per person. I'll PM the Steam Key to whoever claims each game first. I've got a few guest passes on my Steam account that most likely won't be used. If you can guess any of the games I have guest passes for then you get that game - simple as :) Requirements: You must have a computer that can run the game You must genuinely want the game No taking the piss with the ammount of guesses either :P Simples! Winners so far: Audiosurf ( Amnesia (http://www.reddit. </p>
